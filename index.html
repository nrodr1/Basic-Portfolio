			I am an open-minded experimenter, storyteller, and problem solver with a pragmatic, data-driven approach into discovering unrealized insights, exploring new concepts, and tackling challenges at hand.
			</p>
			<p>
			I believe in expanding the possibilities of what we can do with our hyper-connected world and the ever-growing sets of data within our reach.
			</p>
			<p>
			I enjoy being in a transparent, constructive, and critical environment where team members and clients are pushed to discover new ways to forge connections within themselves and with the challenges before them. An environment with people who have diverse experiences and studies that help drive unique perspectives and in turn unique, game-changing ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
			My interests primarily center around client/project management, data mining/analytics, strategic planning around search frictions, homophily, consumer behavior, and social innovation.
